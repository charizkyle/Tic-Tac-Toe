Welcome to my custom Tic-Tac-Toe game! But here’s the twist—instead of Xs and Os, it features Hearts and Stars!
This game was built using Python and Pygame so make sure you have it installed on your system.
1. Install Python. You can download it from python.org.
2. Install Pygame. Open your terminal or command prompt and run: pip install pygame

Note: This is a 2 Player Game:)
